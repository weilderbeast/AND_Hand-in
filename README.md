# AND_Hand-in
Android native(java) repository for the AND1 course.

The name of the app is Telegraph (inspired by telegram). As the name suggests, it is a messaging app,
inspired by the *awesome* Telegram app, that is going to the moon üöÄ. Reasoning behind choosing this is simply being fed up with the quality
of text messaging and the outright stupidity huge companies like Facebook and Google show each time they develop a texting app.
*Examples of times where üí© hit the fan: Google Hangouts(lol), Google Fi, Google+ (lol), Facebook Messenger(great app that never works properly), WhatsApp(was amazing until Facebook bought it).*

Main goal of this app is to work fast and reliable, be lightweight and simple to use. I plan on using phone numbers for authentication at some point to make it more secure and easier to use. I will do my best to also ensure *some* security, wherever possible.

I know the list is big for the scope and time allocated to this project, but I am intentionally making a lot of stories, so I always have something to work on. I also plan on
